# editor-open

You know when you run `git commit`, and an editor pops open so you can enter a
commit message? This is a Haskell library that does that.

This library isn't very portable. It relies on the `$EDITOR` environment
variable. The concept only exists on *nix systems.

# Installing

If you're using this library, I assume you're familiar with the basic
infrastructure of Haskell programs. Just add `editor-open` to the
`build-depends:` field in your project's `.cabal` file.

Alternatively, you can just do a one-off installation with:

```
cabal install editor-open
```
